					What Factors Contribute To Housing Prices In America?
				</h1>
				<div class="color-text">
					<p>
						Housing in different American states is influenced by a myriad of factors,
						each contributing to the unique real estate landscape in their respective regions.
						Key determinants include the crime rate, which impacts neighborhood safety and property values;
						land lot prices, which can vary significantly and affect affordability; the level of
						urbanization,
						which dictates the availability of housing options in metropolitan or rural areas; population
						size and density,
						as they affect demand and supply; GDP per capita, reflecting the economic well-being of
						residents; relative purchasing power,
						influencing affordability and homebuyers' decision-making; and the economic characteristics of
						states based on their largest industries,
						which can create localized housing booms or busts.
						These multifaceted elements collectively shape the housing market across the diverse American
						landscape.

								A choropleth map depicting housing prices across the United States reveals a

								of nearly <strong>$820,000</strong>.
								Moreover, this map can be used to serves as an analytical foundation for predicting
								future housing price trends,
								offering insights into the underlying dynamics of the national real estate market and
								the key factors that impact the

								The bubble chart shows how various local factors impact housing prices. 
								It considers three key elements: Population category (<high>high</high>, <moderate>moderate</moderate>, <low>low</low>), 
								Population Density in square miles, and Crime Rate per 100,000 people. 
								What's clear from the chart is that areas with lower crime rates, especially in comparison to their population density, 
								tend to have higher median housing prices. In simpler terms, safety is a big selling point for homes. 
								On the flip side, places with high crime rates and low population density aren't as appealing to potential residents, 
								indicating that people prioritize safety when choosing where to live.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, a good comparison would be <strong>New York</strong> and <strong>California</strong>. Although they both
								have very high median housing prices, we can see that <strong>New York</strong> has less <strong>crime rate</strong> and has a higher
								<strong>population density</strong> compared to <strong>California</strong>. Therefore, we see that it's price is higher than California's, 
								even though they are very close in housing prices. Obviously there are more factors like economic hubs in different states which could drive
								appeal for more residents.

										<strong>The Great Recession</strong> in 2008 marked a pivotal moment in the U.S. economic landscape. 
										Triggered by the housing market collapse and financial crisis, it had far-reaching consequences, 
										from widespread job losses to a sharp decline in home values. 
									</p>
									<p>
										An interesting correlation to note is the relationship between 
										<INTR>interest</INTR> rates and <MRT>mortgage</MRT> rates. When <INTR>interest</INTR> rates rise, <MRT>mortgage</MRT> rates tend to follow suit by going up as well. 
										Conversely, when <INTR>interest</INTR> rates are lowered, <MRT>mortgage</MRT> rates typically decrease, making borrowing for homes more affordable. 
										This connection between <INTR>interest</INTR> rates and <MRT>mortgage</MRT> rates plays a significant role in shaping the housing market's dynamics and the 
										broader economy.

								The donut chart shows that Year 2000, there was a notable demographic distribution in the United States saw 79.06% of the population residing in <strong>urban</strong> areas, 
								while 20.94% called <strong>rural</strong> areas their home. This <strong>urban</strong> majority reflected a trend of increasing urbanization over the course of the 20th century.
							</p>
							<p>
								This shift was driven by various factors, including economic opportunities, access to services, and the allure of city life. 
								Urban areas will remain alluring for those in search of diverse job markets and modern conveniences.

								Fast-forward 21 years to 2021, this trend continued its upward trajectory, <strong>urban</strong> population rose 3.81%. 
								Even as population increased over the 21 years by nearly 50 million people, the shift in urbanization and the appeal from <strong>urban</strong> amenities, 
								job opportunities, and modern lifestyles pushed Americans out of <strong>rural</strong> areas and into <strong>urban</strong> cities.
							</p>

							<p>
								However, this increased urbanization also poses challenges related to infrastructure, housing affordability, 
								and sustainability. A balance between <strong>urban</strong> development and <strong>rural</strong> preservation is needed to address these problems sustainably.

								The bubble chart provides an insightful visual representation of the interplay between Urbanization Category, 
								Relative Purchasing Power (RPP), Urbanization Index, and GDP per Capita. 
								As the Urbanization Category transitions from <low>low</low> to 
								<high>high</high>, it reveals a disparity between GDP per Capita for the different states.
								The left-most points get shifted along the GDP per Capita axis meaning people become richer as they move 
								from <low>low</low> to <high>high</high> urbanization areas. 
							</p>
							<p>
								This showcases the economic benefits and opportunities associated with urbanization, as regions become more developed and urbanized, 
								resulting in improved income levels and enhanced purchasing power, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of life for their residents.
								Thus, making homes potentially more affordable and desirable. 
								However, it's crucial to recognize that this demand can also lead to increased housing costs in highly urbanized regions.
							</p>
							<p>
								Overall, the visualisation touches on the complexity and the myriad of factors that contribute to the fluctuation of housing prices in 
								the United States. However, this is most likely the same in Australia.
