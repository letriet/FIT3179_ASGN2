					What Factors Contribute To Housing Prices In America?
				</h1>
				<div class="color-text">
					<p>
						Housing in different American states is influenced by a myriad of factors,
						each contributing to the unique real estate landscape in their respective regions.
						Key determinants include the crime rate, which impacts neighborhood safety and property values;
						land lot prices, which can vary significantly and affect affordability; the level of
						urbanization,
						which dictates the availability of housing options in metropolitan or rural areas; population
						size and density,
						as they affect demand and supply; GDP per capita, reflecting the economic well-being of
						residents; relative purchasing power,
						influencing affordability and homebuyers' decision-making; and the economic characteristics of
						states based on their largest industries,
						which can create localized housing booms or busts.
						These multifaceted elements collectively shape the housing market across the diverse American
						landscape.

								A choropleth map depicting housing prices across the United States reveals a
								distribution,
								with <strong>New York</strong> as the notable exception, boasting an average house price
								of nearly <strong>$820,000</strong>.
								Moreover, this map can be used to serves as an analytical foundation for predicting
								future housing price trends,
								offering insights into the underlying dynamics of the national real estate market and
								the key factors that impact the

								The bubble chart shows how various local factors impact housing prices. 
								It considers three key elements: Population category (<high>high</high>, <moderate>moderate</moderate>, <low>low</low>), 
								Population Density in square miles, and Crime Rate per 100,000 people. 
								What's clear from the chart is that areas with lower crime rates, especially in comparison to their population density, 
								tend to have higher median housing prices. In simpler terms, safety is a big selling point for homes. 
								On the flip side, places with high crime rates and low population density aren't as appealing to potential residents, 
								indicating that people prioritize safety when choosing where to live.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, a good comparison would be <strong>New York</strong> and <strong>California</strong>. Although they both
								have very high median housing prices, we can see that <strong>New York</strong> has less <strong>crime rate</strong> and has a higher
								<strong>population density</strong> compared to <strong>California</strong>. Therefore, we see that it's price is higher than California's, 
								even though they are very close in housing prices. Obviously there are more factors like economic hubs in different states which could drive
								appeal for more residents.

										The Great Recession of 2008 marked a pivotal moment in the U.S. economic landscape. 
										Triggered by the housing market collapse and financial crisis, it had far-reaching consequences, 
										from widespread job losses to a sharp decline in home values. Since then, the United States has made a gradual but resilient recovery, 
										with economic indicators showing signs of improvement over the years. An interesting correlation to note is the relationship between 
										interest rates and mortgage rates. When interest rates rise, mortgage rates tend to follow suit by going up as well. 
										Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, mortgage rates typically decrease, making borrowing for homes more affordable. 
										This connection between interest rates and mortgage rates plays a significant role in shaping the housing market's dynamics and the 
										broader economy.
									</p>
									<p>
										Lower interest rates and lower mortgage rates are like a good deal for home buyers. 
										They mean you can borrow money for your home at a cheaper cost. 
										This makes your monthly mortgage payments more affordable and allows you to consider buying a bigger or better home. 
										On the other hand, when interest rates are high, your mortgage costs more, making it harder to afford a home. 
										In simple terms, lower rates are great for buyers because they save money, while higher rates make buying a home more expensive.

										Among the top five states with the highest median housing costs, 
										<strong>Hawaii</strong> stands out with the most expensive land lots, priced at an astonishing $110.86 per square foot. 
									</p>
									<p>
										This remarkable figure underlines the unique real estate landscape of the Aloha State, where the pristine natural 
										beauty and limited land availability contribute to the sky-high prices of land. 
										<strong>Hawaii</strong>'s lush landscapes and breathtaking oceanfront properties come at a premium, 
										making it an exceptional but costly place to own a piece of paradise.

										Of the top five states with the highest median housing costs, 
										<strong>California</strong> is witnessing the most significant depreciation in housing prices, 
										with a year-on-year median growth rate of -5.8%. 
									</p>
									<p>
										One possible reason for this trend could be the state's housing affordability crisis, 
										which has led residents to more affordable regions. Additionally, factors like high property taxes, 
										increasing living costs, and regulations may be dissuading potential homebuyers, 
										leading to a decrease in demand and consequently causing a drop in housing prices.

								The donut chart shows that Year 2000, there was a notable demographic distribution in the United States saw 79.06% of the population residing in urban areas, 
								while 20.94% called rural areas their home. This urban majority reflected a trend of increasing urbanization over the course of the 20th century.
							</p>
							<p>
								This shift was driven by various factors, including economic opportunities, access to services, and the allure of city life. 
								The data from 2000 serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing trend of urbanization, reflecting the changing preferences and 
								needs of the American population. It also laid the groundwork for a trajectory that has continued to evolve, with urbanization rates steadily 
								increasing in subsequent years, redefining the social, economic, and cultural dynamics of the nation.

								Fast-forward 21 years to 2021, the donut chart show that this trend continued its upward trajectory, with the urban population share rising to 82.87%. 
								Even as population increased over the 21 years by nearly 50 million people, the shift in urbanization and the appeal from urban amenities, 
								job opportunities, and modern lifestyles pushed Americans out of rural areas and into urban cities.
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking ahead, the trend of urbanization is likely to continue. 
								As technology and remote work options become more prevalent, urban areas will remain alluring for those in search of diverse job markets 
								and modern conveniences. However, this increased urbanization also poses challenges related to infrastructure, housing affordability, 
								and sustainability. Striking a balance between urban development and rural preservation will be crucial to address the evolving needs 
								of the population and maintain a sustainable and inclusive living environment.

					Urbanization Aftermath: RPP & GDP's Impact On Homebuyers

								The bubble chart provides an insightful visual representation of the interplay between Urbanization Category, 
								Relative Purchasing Power (RPP), Urbanization Index, and GDP per Capita. 
								One striking trend in the chart is the movement from left to right on the x-axis as the Urbanization Category transitions from <low>low</low> to 
								<high>high</high>. 
								This shift reveals a compelling pattern where states with <low>low</low> urbanization tend to have lower GDP per Capita, 
								while as they progress to higher urbanization categories, their income per capita noticeably increases. 
								It showcases the economic benefits and opportunities associated with urbanization, as regions become more developed and urbanized, 
								resulting in improved income levels and enhanced purchasing power, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of life for their residents.
							</p>
							<p>
								As areas become more urbanized, residents tend to earn more, making homes potentially more affordable and desirable. 
								However, it's crucial to recognize that this demand can also lead to increased housing costs in highly urbanized regions.
